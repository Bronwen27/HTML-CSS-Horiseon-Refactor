Code Refactor

### User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Description

In this project I intend to modify the existing code to make it more accessible by simplifying and updating the code without altering the end product.

### Installation

Tasks completed:
- Simplified the HTML index code by condensing elements and removing various class codes and replacing with broader elements.
- Matched the CSS code to the refactored index code.
- Deleted all repetitions.
